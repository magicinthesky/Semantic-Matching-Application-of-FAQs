# Code Style Guidelines

## 1. Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive, self-explanatory names for variables, functions, and classes.
- Follow the language-specific naming conventions (e.g., camelCase for JavaScript, snake_case for Python).
- Prefix boolean variables with "is", "has", or "should" (e.g., isValid, hasPermission).
- Use meaningful and pronounceable names; avoid abbreviations unless they are widely accepted.

## 2. Code Structure
- Keep functions small and focused on a single task.
- Limit function length to 20-30 lines for better readability and maintainability.
- Use consistent indentation and formatting throughout the codebase.
- Group related code together and separate different concerns.
- Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle to avoid code duplication.

## 3. Documentation
- Write clear and concise comments for complex logic or non-obvious code.
- Use docstrings or similar conventions to document functions, classes, and modules.
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes.
- Include examples in documentation for better understanding.
- Document any assumptions, limitations, or edge cases in the code.

## 4. Error Handling
- Use try-catch blocks (or equivalent) to handle exceptions properly.
- Provide informative error messages that help in debugging.
- Log errors with appropriate severity levels.
- Fail fast: detect and report errors as early as possible.
- Use custom exception classes for specific error scenarios when appropriate.

## 5. Performance
- Write efficient code, considering time and space complexity.
- Optimize loops and avoid unnecessary iterations.
- Use appropriate data structures for the task at hand.
- Implement caching mechanisms for expensive operations when suitable.
- Profile and benchmark code to identify performance bottlenecks.

## 6. Security
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for database operations.
- Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Follow the principle of least privilege in access control.
- Keep sensitive information (like API keys) out of the source code.
- Use secure communication protocols (HTTPS) for data transmission.

## 7. Version Control
- Write clear and descriptive commit messages.
- Make small, focused commits that address a single issue or feature.
- Use feature branches for new development and bug fixes.
- Regularly merge or rebase with the main branch to stay up-to-date.
- Perform code reviews before merging changes into the main branch.

## 8. Testing
- Write unit tests for individual components and functions.
- Aim for high test coverage, especially for critical parts of the codebase.
- Include integration tests to verify the interaction between different parts of the system.
- Write testable code by following SOLID principles and dependency injection.
- Run tests automatically as part of the CI/CD pipeline.

## 9. Code Reusability
- Create modular and reusable components.
- Use design patterns appropriately to solve common problems.
- Implement interfaces or abstract classes for better abstraction.
- Favor composition over inheritance when designing class relationships.
- Create utility functions for commonly used operations.

## 10. Maintainability
- Keep the codebase clean and organized.
- Refactor code regularly to improve its structure and readability.
- Follow consistent coding standards across the project.
- Use meaningful file and directory names that reflect their purpose.
- Avoid hard-coding values; use constants or configuration files instead.
